# ReactBeacons
This is for the React Native and React sample code for using Beacons.

The goal of this project is to provide a React Native layer to:
1  iBeacon
2  Eddystone

protocol based beacons.

# What is supported
We are going to support Estimote first. Then Bluvison beacons.

We will commit something to hack on soon.

If you are interested in working on this project get in touch :)
